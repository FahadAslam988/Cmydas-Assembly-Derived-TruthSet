  GATK MarkDuplicates Results Summary
====================================

Sample: CH-NORMS1)
--------------------------
READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED: 436,970,646
READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES: 37,780,610
READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES: 3,774,873 (~10% of duplicate pairs)
PERCENT_DUPLICATION: 8.67%
ESTIMATED_LIBRARY_SIZE: 2,612,848,101

Interpretation:
- Duplication rate is low (under 10%), which is good for downstream variant calling.
- Library complexity is high (large estimated library size).
